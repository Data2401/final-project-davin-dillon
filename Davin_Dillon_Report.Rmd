<span style = "color:navy;, font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><center><h1>Introduction</h1></center>
The Academy Awards, also known as the Oscars, is arguably the ultimate award for any movie. I plan to use the data I have collected to investigate the relationship between Oscars and money. Do Oscar winning movies cost more to make than movies that lose Oscars? Do both of these sets of movies cost more than movies that are not nominated? Do Oscar winners, Oscar loser, or non-nominated movies make more gross revenue? Which of these has the highest percentage profit? I will use the data to answer these questions and more. Along the way, I will also try to highlight some interesting statistics and facts. By analyzing this data, I hope to shed some light on whether production companies pay for Oscars, profit by making Oscars, both, or neither. 

Also, by choosing a fun topic I hope that people looking find answers that they enjoy thinking about. It is certainly true that I had fun looking for my own answers.

<span style = "color:navy;, font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><center><h1>Data Preparation</h1></center>
Most of these 8 libraries are used extensively, while a couple have only one or two functions that came in handy for things I wanted to accomplish in the presentation.
</span>

```{r}

library(tidyverse) # multiple tidy packages
library(readr) # for reading files
library(ggplot2) # for plotting
library(plotly) # for interactive plotting
library(dplyr) # data manipulation
library(flextable) # pretty tables
library(formattable) # comma function formatting numbers
library(gridExtra) # side by side plots

```

<span style = "color:navy;, font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Here I read in the four data sets I wound up using. I give a brief explanation of each below.</span>

```{r}

budget <- read_csv('movies_budget.csv') # budget including new movies
oscars <- read_csv('the_oscar_award.csv') # oscar winners and losers

meta <- read_csv('movies_metadata.csv') # majority of data used

inflation <- read_csv('inflation_data.csv') 
# inflation data for calculations

```

<span style = "color:navy;, font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><h2>Paying for Oscars or Oscars for Pay?</h2><ul><li>The largest part of my data comes from a data set I got from github. [<a style = 'color:green;'>yash91sharma github</a>](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yash91sharma/IMDB-Movie-Dataset-Analysis/master/movie_metadata.csv) created the data for a project similar to mine in which they asked which countries made the most movies.This data set contains `r comma(nrow(meta), digits = 0)` rows of data and seems to have been made around 2017.</li>

<li>I used [<a style = 'color:green;'>alexsychu kaggle</a>](https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexsychu/movie-industry-eda-alex-chu-5-april-2022/data) to gather some more data up to 2020. This second dat set had an additional `r comma(nrow(budget), digits = 0)` rows of data. This user was trying to answer the question of how to predict if a movie will do well.

</li><li>Lastly for movie data, I used data from [<a style = 'color:green;'>unanimad kaggle</a>](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unanimad/the-oscar-award) . This data set had `r comma(nrow(oscars),digits = 0)` rows of data and this kaggle user asked various questions about who won Oscars.

</li><li>My last and only 'non-movie' data set comes from [<a style = 'color:green;'>officialdata.org</a>](https://www.officialdata.org/us/inflation/1800?amount=1#:~:text=Value%20of%20%241%20from%201800%20to%202022&text=The%20dollar%20had%20an%20average,Labor%20Statistics%20consumer%20price%20index.) , where I obtained 223 rows of inflation data which allowed me to calculate budgets and gross revenue with inflation as a factor.</li></ul></span>

<span style = "color:navy;, font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><h2>Data Wrangling</h2>
There were many renames and some work to choose a movie budget in some cases. Once I had the columns I wanted, I set in on joining the data together. First, I joined the meta data with the budget data to include all of the titles for which I had information. My next adventure (or misadventure) was to join this data with the inflation data. Once that was done, all that was left was joining this information with the Oscar data. All in all, I used three full joins. </span>



```{r}

oscars <- oscars %>%    # rename year for join
  rename('year' = 'year_film')

meta$year <-  format(as.Date(meta$release_date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"), "%Y")

blue = '#000080' # just the color code I wanted to use for my print
  
meta <- meta %>% 
  mutate(year = as.numeric(year)) # easier use for comparisons/inflation

# renames
budget <- budget %>% 
  rename(vote_average = score) %>% # renaming vote data for joins etc
  rename(vote_count = votes) %>% 
  rename(Title = 'Movie Title')


oscars <- oscars %>% 
  rename(Title = 'film')  # rename for joins

adj <- inflation %>% 
  mutate(multiplier = (22.82/amount)) 
# create multiplier column for easy calculations

budget <- budget %>% 
  rename(new_budget = Budget)  # rename for joins etc


options(scipen = 100) # avoid scientific notation 

full_budget <- full_join(meta, budget, on = 'Title') 
# full join of metadata and budget data to get new and old movies etc

full_bud <- full_budget %>% 
  mutate(budget = pmax(new_budget, meta_budget, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  select(Title,genres, budget,new_budget, meta_budget, popularity,year,
         release_date, revenue, runtime, vote_average,
         vote_count,gross)
# set budget to max of two different budgets.
# picking max is arbitrary, but needed in most cases


full_bud <- full_bud[-c(1,2,3),] %>%
   arrange(desc(as.numeric(budget)))
# remove first three unnecessary rows


full_bud <- full_bud %>%  # replace 1900 sentinels with 2022
  mutate(year = replace(year, year == 1900, 2022))
# Most of these seemed to be less known movies
# so I thought that 2022 would do the least harm 
# with the inflation numbers

adj_bud <- full_join(full_bud, adj,
                             on = c('Title', 'year')) %>% 
  mutate(with_inflation = (as.numeric(budget) * (multiplier))) %>% 
  mutate(gross_inflation = (as.numeric(full_bud$gross)
                            * (multiplier))) %>% 
  select(Title,genres,vote_average, vote_count, budget,
         with_inflation, gross_inflation, year, gross,
         release_date) %>% 
  arrange(desc(with_inflation))  # joining movies with inflation
# creating with_inflation(budget) and gross_inflation columns
# arranging by highest with_inflation budgets


osc_bud <-  full_join(adj_bud, oscars, on  = c('Title'))
# joining all other data to Oscars data
# This is the starting point for most of my data manipulation
# 62706 entries, 15 total columns, of which 8 columns used.

```
<span style = "color:navy;, font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I wound up only using 8 of the 15 columns of my final data set. I had planned to look at other aspects, but I eventually realized that was too much for this presentation. Maybe someone else will see what I have done, and decide to dig deeper. Maybe I will come back to it someday.</span>

[The data I was able to collect contains `r comma(nrow(oscar_titles), digits = 0)` movies nominated for an Academy Award since its inception in 1929. Of these `r comma(nrow(oscar_titles),digits = 0)` movies. `r comma(nrow(oscar_wn_titles), digits = 0)` won at least one award. There have been `r comma(nrow(total_noms), digits = 0)` total Oscar nominations, and `r comma(nrow(total_wins), digits = 0)` total Oscar wins in the dataset. `r comma(nrow(bst_pic), digits = 0)` movies have been nominated for Best Picture in its many forms. Out of these, `r comma(nrow(bst_pic_won), digits = 0)` won. `r comma(nrow(bst_act %>% distinct(Title)), digits = 0)` movies have had an actor or actress nominated in either a leading or supporting role.  `r comma(nrow(bst_act_wn), digits = 0)` movies had at least one winner in an acting category. ]{style="color:navy;, font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"}
